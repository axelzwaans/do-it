# UX

## User stories

Before starting this project, I thought about how this software application might provide value to a user. Using agile methodology, I identified a set of user stories and and used GitHub projects to document them. I tagged them either as 'must have' (this is functionality which my app has) and 'could have' (functionality which my app doesn't have, but would be a good feature.)

### User Accounts

1. As a **user** I can **register for an account** so that **I can write a blog and view other blog posts**.
2. As a **user** I can **log in and out of my account** so that **I will be the only one with access to it**.
3. As a **user** I can **log in using my email address** so that **my login information is consistent**.
4. As a **user** I can **view my account details** including **date joined and number of blog posts**.
5. As a **user** I can **update my username** so that **I can change it whenever I feel like**.

### User Blog

1. As a **user** I can **easily start blogging** so that **I can focus on what I'm writing rather than how to get set up**.
2. As a **user** i can **view my blog posts on the same page as the blog entry page** so that **I have a clear overview of what's going on**.
3. As a **user** I can **see the date on which my blog posts were created** so that **I can keep track of them**.
4. As a **user** I can **view other users' account information and blog posts** so that **I get a good understanding of who else is using the app**.
5. As a **user** I can **comment on other users' blog posts** so that I can **easily interact with them**.
6. As a **user** I can **view comments other users have made on my blog posts**.
7. As a **user** I can **like and unlike other people's blog posts** so that **I can give feedback without having to leave a comment**.
8. As a **user** I can **edit my own blog posts** so that **I can make alterations or fix mistakes**.
9. As a **user** I can **delete my own blog posts** so that **I don't need to worry about anything being permanent**.

### ADMIN

1. As a **site admin** I can **have a clear overview of all users registered to the site along with their account information**.
2. As a **site admin** I can **delete all users' blog posts**.
3. As a **site admin** I can **delete user accounts**.

## Design

### General, colour, font

This app has been built and customized using Bootstrap. The colour scheme was inspired by a cool image I found on google which matched the type of style I wanted for this project. I used this image as the main image on the landing page, and adjusted colouring throughout the app accordingly. I kept the design very simple, focusing on functionality and user-friendliness. I used 'Oxygen' as the main font in the app because of its simple and elegant style. I chose 'Sans-Serif' as a back up incase the primary font is unable to load. 

### Wireframes

I created a low-fidelity wireframe using Balsamiq to help me design my app. I created a mock up of each page;

## Entity Relationship Model

I added a graphical representation in the form of an entity relationship model to depict the relationship between entities within my models. I used Lucidchart to design it.
